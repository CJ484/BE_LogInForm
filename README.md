# - ðŸ“‘ - Log In Form - ðŸ’» -

This is my demo of creating a Back End Server and incorporating it in a Log In form. This is also to show my understanding of
Node.js, Express.js, PostgreSQL, Prisma.io, TypeScript and Next.js. I used Netlify to host my Front End Website and Heroku to host my Back end Server, while AWS will be hosting the PostgreSQL Database. 

### ** Disclaimer ** Please do not enter real emails or passwords, this app is intent for showcasing only

This is considered the Back-End API that handles all requests from the log in form. After the HTTP Post request is received, Express.js will follow the respected instruction to either Create, Read, Update, or Delete the Data using prisma functions to connect and interact to PostgreSQL database. After the credentials are received they go through the functiom and return a response/error back to the user.
